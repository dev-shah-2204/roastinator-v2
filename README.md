# Utility/Moderation Discord Bot

I expect that you know basic python before viewing this code. If not, the comments through out the code might help you, but I wouldn't count on it.

You are free to use/change the code in any manner you like.

I would appreciate if you could *fork* the changes you make instead of just saving and changing as it would help other people making a discord bot.
