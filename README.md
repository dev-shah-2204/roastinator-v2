# Utility/Moderation Discord Bot

I'm assuming you know basic python before viewing this code. If not, you are going to have a hard time customizing it. I have put a lot of comments all over the code to help you understand

Refer LICENSE for copyright details. *Spoiler Alert*: You can do anything you like with this code. Heck even copy it all and say it's your own and I can't say anything, **but**, I would appreciate it if you could *fork* the changes you make instead of just saving and changing as it would help other people make their own discord bot.

## Why the code is so weird
I have no clue why I made a separate file for each command. I regret it but I don't want to spend time to merge them now. However, I think it makes it easier to find code. The commands are in specific categorized folders and in files whose names are... well the commands.

## YouTube
There are tons of YouTube videos that show in detail how to make your own Discord Bot using python. If you have difficulty understanding how to make a bot here, well, this isn't a tutorial. This is code for you to copy and paste to add features to your bot without spending a lot of time. Check out [Carberra Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC13cYu7lec-oOcqQf5L-brg) and [Code With Swastik](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ITRZ4_Di-KMHSIylTQbBA). They have a great series of tutorials on a python discord bot.

## Other open-sourced bots
[Carl-Bot](https://github.com/CarlGroth/Carl-Bot) - Has great features.
[YAGPDP](https://github.com/jonas747/yagpdb) - Also has great features. It's not made in python.


## Some important pointers:
} For understanding how cogs work, refer to the first cog i.e. `cogs/events/on_message`
} More notes will be coming in future
